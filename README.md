I have Implemented this Restaurant Management System in both C and Java.

In C code, 'Restaurant Management System' project integrated Linked List, Array, Sorting, and other data structures.It efficiently managed restaurant operations by facilitating menu management, order processing, inventory tracking, and customer management. The system enhanced overall efficiency and effectiveness in handling daily activities.

In Java code, 'Restaurant Management System' project integrated Object Oriented Programming, Inheritance, Linked List, Array, Sorting, and other data structures.
